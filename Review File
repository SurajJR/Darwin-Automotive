--------------------REVIEW 1------------------
I have gone through the website on 30 November, 2019 at 09:37 AM.
Love It:
1. The website layout is well planned.
2. I'm guessing that the contact us form is working. It would be really good if it is working as of now.
3. The header is actually awesome. Its simple and hangs at the top. Great job on that.
4. The images and the GIF loads without any delay.
5. it's good that you maintained a black and white theme. We can change it later accordingly.

Loathe It:
1. When the browser window is resized, the elements don't resize themselves. And the team members cards don't align properly.
2. When navigating to different sections, the transition is not smooth.
3. The images don't rezise themselves.

Overall, the website layout clean and calm on the eyes. A few corrections are:
Our Font: Helvetica Neue. Use this font for the whole website. The Character type is the header will be Helvetica Neue Bold.

Great Job on the website! Please follow-up with the above points.
